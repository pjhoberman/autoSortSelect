This plugin attaches a selectable list of sorted items to an input.

Dependencies:
    jQuery
    Underscore
    String Score
    
Usage:
    $( selector ).autoSortSelect(options)
    Clicking on an item will set the text of the input to that item's text, set the input's .data('selected_option') to the resulting id, and set data-autosortselect to the id.
    
Options:
    DATAZ - An array of JSON object. Each must have a key of 'name', unless otherwise specified
    name - The key in DATAZ where each item's text can be found
    id - The key in DATAZ to set each item's id to
    id_prefix - Each item gets an id of the input's id plus (if it exists, otherwise it is set to autoSortSelect) the selector's id. You can override the prefix here.
    input_css - CSS object (example: {color:'#000',height:100})
        I don't think this one is required.. since you can just edit the input yourself. but.. why not.
    select_css - CSS object (example: {color:'#000',height:100})
    data-attr - the data attr of the input, set to the selected item's id
